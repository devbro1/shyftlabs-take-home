### HelperComps

these are the useful components in multiple components of project \
they aren't pages or UIKit components, they are sth like specific cards or tables

#### Components:

-   fullPageLoading: simple loading that covers hole page

-   index.ts: reexport reusable things of hole data folder.\
    so every where you can import them just from 'helperComps' instead of 'helperComps/sth.ext'

```javascript
import { AnyComp } from 'helperComps';
```
