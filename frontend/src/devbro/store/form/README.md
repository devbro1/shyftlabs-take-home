### StoreFormComp

Create/edit store page of app

#### notes:

-   this page handles both create & edit page

-   after submit the form user will be back to list of stores

-   so after successfully submit the form we hide the form and display message.

#### TODO:

-   add multi select input

-   use helper component for loading state

-   error handling

-   if we have to use loading instead of skeleton, enhance and separate loading status instead of temporary loading.
